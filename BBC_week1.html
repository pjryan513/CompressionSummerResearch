<h2>
  <p>Byte-aligned Bitmap Code overview:</p>
</h2>
  <body>

    <p>BBC starts off by grouping bits into 8-bit bytes.
      BBC contructs runs of the form of a header that gives information about the type of run, followed by a fill, followed by a literal tail, with a .
      A fill has a 1 in the MSB with the tail having 0 in the MSB (not sure on this might be the reverse).
      BBC has four kinds of runs.
      Fills in BBC are either a 0-fill and 1-fill with the fill bits being 0 and 1 repectedly.
      There are actually two types of BBC's, one-sided and two-sided.
      One-sided only compresses 0-fills and two-sided compresses both 0-fills and 1-fills.
      The paper recommends using 0-fills for sparse data like we are using but addeding two-sided would also be usefully.</p>
    <ul> Types of runs
      <li>1:  The first kind of run contains 0-3 bytes in the fill and 0-15 bytes in the tail.
      The header byte for type 1 runs is as follows [ 1 | fill_bit (1 bits) | fill_length (2 bits) | tail_length (4 bits) ].
      Type 1 runs should be used when there are few or no fills in current sequence of bytes.</li>
      <li>2:  The second kind of run contains 0-3 bytes in the fill and has a single literal byte that contains only 1 bit that differs from the fill bit of the header, this differnt bit is called the odd bit.
      The header byte is a follows [ 0 | 1 | fill_bit (1 bit) | fill_length (2 bits) | odd_bit_position (3 bits)].
      This run is used when a byte would be a fill expect for a single odd bit.
      Instead of storing the literal byte we toss it out and use the odd bit position in the header byte to know that the literal has the same bits as the fill expect for one odd bit.</li>
      <li>3:  The third kind of run contains more than 3 bytes for the fill and 0-15 bytes for the tail.
      The header byte is as follows [ 0 | 0 | 1 | fill_bit (1 bit) | tail_length (4 bits)].
      Instead of fill_length bits mulitbyte counters are used to tell the length of the fill.
      The closer a counter byte the header byte is the more significant it is.
      The MSB of a counter byte indicates if another counter byte is to follow.  1 means more 0 means none.
      The last counter byte will than have a 0 in the MSB.
      So the value of the fill is the concanated the lower seven bits of each counter byte, then four is added to this value and that is the length of the fill.
      This type of run should be used when there is a large sequence of similar bits.</li>
      <li>4:  This run is a combination of runs two and three.  It uses more than 3 bytes for the counter and 1 byte for the tail containing an odd bit.
      The header for this type is [ 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | fill_bit (1 bit) | odd_bit_position (3 bits)].
      The counter bytes are the same as the ones found in type 3 run and the odd bit is handled the same as type 2 run.
      This type of run is used when there are a large number of similar bits in a sequence but a single odd bit breaks the sequence.</li>
    </ul>
