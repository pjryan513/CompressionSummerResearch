void compressColumn(int col, int threadNum){

opens uncompressed file
gets which column she's' on
create a file to write to (each column corresponds to a file), 
also open that file for writing
she counts everything by words here... maybe we should too? even though we're byte-aligned we could also go
by word at the block level. most CPUs deal with words anyways
puts the segment of words into the struct

she also saves the number of words
then she saves compressUsingWAH on the blockSeg of words. we could even get away with doing
this I think... we could just save a few more variables of overhead in our BBCCompressor file? 


compressUnstriped: 

she allocates a word array buffer with however many words are in the segment. we need to do the same but with bytes? 
maybe just define word as 8 bits in the control file. 

in the control file, just set word_32 and word_read to bytes since they're all over the place in RawBitmapReader.c
FLAG_BITS doesn't really matter for our implementation, neither does BASE_LEN, we can just set them to 0 and 8 respectively.
